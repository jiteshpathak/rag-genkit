For this RAG application,  let's grab data from the web. To ingest web data, we'll need to fetch it from a URL and then extract the main content from the returned HTML. I've written before about how I like to use Readability.js to parse out the content from a page, so we'll follow that. We'll also need something to turn the content into chunks, let's use llm-chunk for this as it's relatively simple.\\nInstall the dependencies:\\nImport them at the top of the script:Write a function that takes a URL, fetches the HTML content, extracts the content and returns it.\\nThe next thing to do is write our first Genkit flow to ingest data from a URL into the collection.
